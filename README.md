# odin-recipes

This project is a simple HTML webpage that shows recipes for a series of dishes. It has a header, a photo (credited) of the dish, a list of the required ingredients, and the directions to make the dish. The three dishes I chose were lasagna, sweet and sour chicken and peach-stuffed pork chops. This used simple boilerplate code and much repetition in the individual page designs.
